Zstd-jni provides Java Native Interface bindings for the Zstd native library.
Zstandard, or zstd for short, is a fast, lossless compression algorithm,
targeting real-time compression scenarios at zlib-level and better compression
ratios.

This port does not depend on archivers/zstd, instead it builds and embeds its
own copy of the native library. The embedded native library version is the
value of this port's DISTVERSION to the left of the hyphen.
